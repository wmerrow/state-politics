      <h1>How Republicans Keep Winning at the State Level, and Why It Matters</h1>

      <p>New Hampshire’s 2020 election results look a little odd. The state voted for the Democratic nominee, as it has done in the past five presidential elections, and reelected its all-Democratic congressional delegation. But the state government is now deep red: the Republican governor cruised to an easy reelection and the GOP took back control of both chambers in the state legislature.</p>
      
      <p>At the state level, three institutions matter: the <strong>governor</strong>, <strong>state senate</strong>, and <strong>state house (sometimes called assembly)</strong>. If a party controls all three, like Republicans in New Hampshire, they have a "trifecta" and can pass laws without support from the other party.</p>

      <p>In the 2020 election, Democrats won the presidency and both chambers of congress, but Republicans won more control at the state level:</p>

        <!-- step 0 -->
        <div>
          <p>Twenty-three states, amounting to 41% of the U.S. population, have a Republican governor and a Republican majority in the house and senate. Democratic trifectas govern only fifteen states, amounting to 37% of the country. In the remaining states, control is split, with neither party controlling all three institutions.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- step 1 -->
        <div>
          <p>If we arrange states from left to right according to their vote in the 2020 presidential election, we can see that New Hampshire is the most extreme case, although there are other states that voted for Biden but where Republicans have full control at the state level.</p>
          <p>Part of this is due to Trump's weakness as a candidate: on the whole, state-level Republicans got more votes than the former Preident. But it is also a result of gerrymandering, where the party in control of a state government draws district boundaries to pack opposing voters into as few districts as possible, giving their candidates an advantage. This is part of the reason Republicans did so well in New Hampshire - they drew the boundaries during the last redistricting process, when they controlled the state government in 2011.</p>

        <!-- step 2 -->
        <div>
          <p>This map may not be surprising to us in 2021, but getting to this point was a multi-generational GOP project.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- step 3 -->
        <div>
          <p>The past half century shows a pattern of Republican gains at the state level, with <strong>two key elections</strong> taking the GOP from irrelevance to the dominant position it holds today.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- step 4 -->
        <div>
          <p>After the Watergate scandal in the 1970s, Democratic trifectas governed 62 percent of the country, while Republicans had no trifecta control.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- step 5 -->
        <div>
          <p>Over the next two decades, Republicans made uneven gains, although Democrats still held an edge in 1994. tktk about Republican strategy in 1994.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- step 3 -->
        <div>
          <p>The 1994 election turned out to be a Republican wave, with the GOP winning full control of several large states. When state governments began their sessions in 1995, Republicans held more power than Democrats for the first time since the 70s.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- step 4 -->
        <div>
          <p>Over the next fifteen years, Democrats regained some ground, and on the eve of the 2010 election held a small advantage in state governments. At the federal level, Democrats were riding high, with a supermajority in the senate which had just passed Obama's signature health care legislation.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- step 5 -->
        <div>
          <p>Recognizing the importance of controlling redistricting in 2011, Republicans decided to invest heavily at the state level in the 2010 election. The Republican State Leadership Committee, the GOP’s fundraising arm focused on the state level, invested <strong>$32 million</strong> in state elections, a 50% increase over their spending in the 2008 cycle. By contrast, the Democrats' committee spent only <strong>$11 million</strong>, a decrease from 2008.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- step 6 -->
        <div>
          <p>The result was an electoral massacre, with the GOP flipping X chambers as part of the 2010 wave.</p>
          <p>This gave Republicans trifectas in 20 states amounting to <strong>44% of the population</strong>. Crucially, their victory happened just before the 2011 redistricting process, meaning each trifecta immediately had the chance to new district boundaries that would last until 2020.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- step 7 -->
        <div>
          <p>In 2020, eyeing the upcoming redistricting process and hoping to avoid the mistakes of 2010, Democrats invested heavily in state-level races, spending tktk.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Democrats won at the national level, defeating President Trump by 7 million votes, but failed to make gains at the state level. In fact, the only changes in control at the state level were Republicans winning the governorship of Montana, and flipping the New Hampshire house and senate to Republican control.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>While most attention was focused on the presidential race, the 2020 state elections were of critical importance because in 2021 states draw <strong>new boundaries for legislative districts</strong> as part of the redistricting process. This creates the opportunity for <strong>gerrymandering</strong>, where the party drawing the boundaries does so in a way where it ends up with more seats than it would otherwise.</p>
          <!-- <p>One reason Republicans did well in New Hampshire is that they drew the boundaries .</p> -->
